					<p><strong>A Collaborative Approach &amp; Employing Basic Psychological Principles</strong></p>
					<p>We often see teams of people working together, both face-to-face and virtually – to solve a problems or develop a solution for a need. Whether it is a sales team working collectively to close a deal, the management team developing a strategy or a medical research team working to find a cure, groups of people are often brought together to tackle big problems.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>We are not limiting this to internal practices at Boxmodel. There is a great benefit in developing a working practice with others to deliver expert and effective solutions to problems and needs.</p>
					<p>So, what predicts how successful these groups will be?</p>
					<p>In the 1900’s a term called general Intelligence “G” came in to Vogue. This was the thought process that someone performing well in one area of intellect would more than likely perform well in another. This is of course a very contentious topic. One, which has evolved, been challenged and ultimately somewhat surpassed.&nbsp; The prediction of success can no longer be assessed using one single denominator.</p>
					<p>One can suggest that this change may have seen the shift to collaborative working for ultimate potential outcomes.</p>
					<p>As a software house delivering complex solutions to some global corporations, we need to consider how to predict the levels of success of collaborative team approaches in the development process and beyond.</p>
					<p>Initially the prediction of success of a group was the sum of the individuals “G” values. Now, we all know that this only predicts one area of deliverable ability. This method suggested that the intellect level (“G” score) of the group is the sole indicator as to the potential success. I am sure that you will agree that this is far from ideal and it really is not the case. Anyone who has worked as part of a team will know that the effectiveness of the delivery potential of the group is not merely down to each person’s knowledge. It takes a great deal more than that!</p>
					<p>A great deal of research has been carried out and we owe it to our clients to take heed of such findings. Researchers in one study recruited around 700 people to then split them in to working parties with relevant skill requirements for the situation subject to observation. The tasks ranged from very simple problem solving through to complex research and development tasks.</p>
					<p>Some referred to the predictive score of the group working as a “C” score. Now collective intelligence, in our view, can’t be the sole driver for success. Experience, personality and creative thinking are all key attributes in our industry.</p>
					<p>So why is this relevant to Software and Digital developments I hear you ask? And more specifically to Boxmodel Digital Media. Well, it is fairly straightforward. We are Software and Digital specialists. This is what our highly qualified and experienced software developers do. We work as a team, with the project teams consisting of individuals from the commercial, creative, front-end development and server side development.</p>
					<p>When working alone, focus will be very precise on the given task. Working as a team, focus will remain precise but there will be peripheral considerations and observations, promoting dynamic proactive solution developments. As a software house we work heavily with the Agile Scrum methodology, itself, embracing the whole team interaction on a daily basis.</p>
					<p>I must iterate that this approach is not limited to the internal development process. We recognise that many projects we are involved with need pre and post development interaction and support. This is where we have really been able to stand out from the crowd. Only a matter of week ago, I was asked my views on conventional marketing companies learning how to code. This could ignite a lengthy debate and is of course subject to personal views and opinions. My views are simple, straightforward and employ basic cognitive principles. Marketing companies are specialists in their fields, diluting that will result in their service area suffering and becoming less effective. The delivery of any software (coding) will also potentially be, diluted, less robust and not as polished. They would be better placed to employ and develop intrenched working relationships with software specialists who can support the marketing need and targeted outcome.</p>
					<p>Focus and experience is required for specialist solution supply and implementation. Each project may require numerous solutions. The collaborative approach ensures that each of the service needs are addressed by the most appropriate suppliers, whilst maximising the principles detailed earlier in this paper.</p>
					<p>How have Boxmodel employed this multi-partner approach? Well, we recognised the needs to work closely with certain sectors. Careful selection of specialist partners, through due diligence, referrals and trial projects has allowed us to rest assured that those we work with, work seamlessly, in unison to deliver solutions which exceed expectation.</p>
					<p>Rather simply, we start out with a small project; assess the delivery thus allowing us to predict the effectiveness of future more complex projects. After each project the collaborative elements of the project are closely reviewed to ensure that the maximum results have been achieved.</p>
					<p>Working together to provide a better solution.</p>
